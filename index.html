        <h2>Dev Process</h2>
        <p>The development of GradConnect was a collaborative effort that spanned several stages:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Conceptualization</strong>: We started by identifying the need for a platform that connects graduates with mentors to ease their transition into the job market.</li>
            <li><strong>Planning</strong>: Detailed planning sessions helped us outline the features, user experience, and technical requirements.</li>
            <li><strong>Design</strong>: Our design phase focused on creating a user-friendly interface and intuitive navigation.</li>
            <li><strong>Development</strong>: Using agile methodologies, we iteratively built and tested each feature, ensuring functionality and reliability.</li>
            <li><strong>Testing and Refinement</strong>: Rigorous testing and user feedback guided us in refining GradConnect to meet user expectations.</li>
            <li><strong>Deployment</strong>: GradConnect was deployed incrementally, ensuring a smooth rollout and integration with user feedback.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>This structured approach allowed us to create a robust platform that supports graduates in their career journey.</p>

        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>GradConnect was inspired by our own experiences as recent graduates facing the challenges of entering the job market. We realized how valuable it would have been to have access to mentors who could provide guidance and advice. This personal journey motivated us to create GradConnect to help other graduates have a smoother transition into their careers.</p>
        <p>The project began in January 2024 as a Portfolio Project for Holberton School. It reflects our dedication to leveraging technology to solve real-world problems and our commitment to continuous learning and growth.</p>
